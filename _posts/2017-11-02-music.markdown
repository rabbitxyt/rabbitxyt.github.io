这首歌第一次听好像是在玩 XBox 的跳舞游戏的时候，今天又在 Youtube 上听到了钢琴/大提琴版的，比原曲更加柔和，超级好听！

下面是原曲，歌词我挺喜欢的，希望每个人都能练就钢铁般的心。

<br>You shout it out

But I can't hear a word you say

I'm talking loud not saying much

I'm criticized but all your bullets ricochet

You shoot me down, but I get up



<br>

I'm bulletproof nothing to lose

Fire away, fire away

Ricochet, you take your aim

Fire away, fire away

You shoot me down but I won't fall

I am titanium

You shoot me down but I won't fall

I am titanium



<br>

Cut me down


But it's you who has further to fall

Ghost town, haunted love

Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones

I'm talking loud not saying much





<br>

I'm bulletproof nothing to lose

Fire away, fire away

Ricochet, you take your aim

Fire away, fire away

You shoot me down but I won't fall

I am titanium

You shoot me down but I won't fall

I am titanium

I am titanium

I am titanium...



<br>

Stone-hard, machine gun

Firing at the ones who run

Stone-hard, thus bulletproof glass


<br>
You shoot me down but I won't fall

 I am titanium

You shoot me down but I won't fall

 I am titanium

You shoot me down but I won't fall

 I am titanium

You shoot me down but I won't fall

 I am titanium



<br>

I am titanium

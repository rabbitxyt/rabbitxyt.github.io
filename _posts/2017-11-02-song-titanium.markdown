非常有节奏感的一首歌。今天在 Youtube 上听到了钢琴/大提琴版的，比原曲更加柔和~ 链接：<span class='nd'>[Titanium / Pavane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz4MzJTeL0c)</span>

下面是原曲，希望每个人都能如歌词所唱的，练就钢铁般的强大的心。

<br>You shout it out

But I can't hear a word you say

I'm talking loud not saying much

I'm criticized but all your bullets ricochet

You shoot me down, but I get up


<br>
I'm bulletproof nothing to lose

Fire away, fire away

Ricochet, you take your aim

Fire away, fire away

You shoot me down but I won't fall

I am titanium

You shoot me down but I won't fall

I am titanium



<br>
Cut me down


But it's you who has further to fall

Ghost town, haunted love

Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones

I'm talking loud not saying much





<br>
I'm bulletproof nothing to lose

Fire away, fire away

Ricochet, you take your aim

Fire away, fire away

You shoot me down but I won't fall

I am titanium

You shoot me down but I won't fall

I am titanium

I am titanium

I am titanium...



<br>
Stone-hard, machine gun

Firing at the ones who run

Stone-hard, thus bulletproof glass


<br>
You shoot me down but I won't fall

 I am titanium

You shoot me down but I won't fall

 I am titanium

You shoot me down but I won't fall

 I am titanium

You shoot me down but I won't fall

 I am titanium



<br>
I am titanium
